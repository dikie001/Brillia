# TODO: Create Settings.tsx Page

## Tasks
- [x] Add Settings interface to src/types.ts for type safety (theme and soundsEnabled).
- [x] Implement full Settings page in src/pages/Settings.tsx: Theme toggle (integrate with existing useTheme hook), Sound toggle (persist in localStorage), Progress reset (clear relevant localStorage keys with confirmation).
- [x] Update src/hooks/useSound.tsx to respect soundsEnabled flag from localStorage before playing sounds.
- [x] Refine Settings.tsx: Remove redundant state for theme (use hook), fix TypeScript errors, ensure consistent styling with Tailwind and dark mode.
- [x] Test integration: Theme affects site-wide, sounds toggle works, progress reset clears trackers.
- [x] Verify no breaking changes to Navbar, MobileNav, or other pages.

All tasks completed. Settings page is fully implemented and integrated.
