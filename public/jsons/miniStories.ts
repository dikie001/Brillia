    title: "The Whispering Baobab",
    content:
      "In the quiet village of Kitui, a massive baobab tree stood at the center of the market. Every evening, children swore they heard it whisper their names. Fourteen-year-old Kendi decided to test the rumor. One night, she crept under the moonlight and touched the bark. The whispers grew into full sentences, telling stories of the village long before she was born. The baobab spoke of heroes, of droughts survived, and of hidden treasures buried beneath its roots. Determined to prove her bravery, Kendi dug and unearthed an old calabash filled with scrolls detailing forgotten traditions. She realized the whispers weren’t haunting, but guiding. The baobab had preserved the village’s memory, and now it had chosen her to become the storyteller of her generation.",
